This is Teja Durgi, 

I started programming from an early age and got a bachelor's degree,
so I can say that my interest in this field has increased over time. Working in the technology sector  has given me the right experience in the industry.
As today's businesses become more and more inseparable from information technology, I strive to apply my expertise to bridge the gap between technology and business. 


My main interest is only to share my technical know-how with people. I really enjoy working on technical issues and developing new ideas.
I also believe in ideology to think before acting. This allows us to focus on innovation as well as continuous improvement.

ok it's me making demo.
